# Intend

**Avoid redundancy when storing data !**

Or, as stated in [_GoF_](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) :
> Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

To put it in a nutshell : **Space optimization technique** ;)

Note : The _Flyweight_ is a shared object that can be used simultaneously in multiple contexts but the _Client_ will not even be able to know that this object is shared in another context.

You should use the _Flyweight_ pattern in the following cases :
 - The **naive approach** (create as many objects as you need) would be **prohibitively expensive**.
   - For example, using an object for each particle of a _particles system_ or each character of a _text editor_ probably would not fit into the available RAM.
 - Your application should be able to support a **large number of objects** which barely fit into available RAM.
 - You application contains objects with **duplicate states that could be extracted** and shared between multiple objects. (_Extrinsic states_)
 - Your application does **not depend on objects identity**.

# How it's done

**Participants**

 - _Flyweight_ : Interface on which _Flyweights_ act on extrinsic state.
 - _ConcreteFlyweight_ : 
   - Implements _Flyweight_ interface.
   - Declares the storage of intrinsic state if needed.
   - Must be **shareable** and **context-independent** (i.e. the states it stores have to be context-independent).
 - _UnsharedConcreteFlyweight_ : For the _Flyweight_ objects that do not need to be shared.
 - _FlyweightFactory_ :
   - **Creates and manages** _Flyweight_ objects.
   - Control proper sharing between clients calls.
 - _Client_ :
   - Maintains a reference to a _Flyweight_.
   - Computes or stores the extrinsic state of _Flyweights_.

**How to implement**

 1. **Separate the fields** of the class to become a Flyweight
   - _Intrinsic states_
     - Contextual data unique to each object that cannot be shared.
   - _Extrinsic states_
     - Independents from context and shared by many objects
     - To be removed from shared objects.
 2. Leave the fields that represent the intrinsic state in the class, but make sure theyâ€™re immutable. They should take their initial values only inside the constructor.
 3. You might consider **creating a _FlyweightFactory_** class to **manage the pool of _Flyweights_** (check for existence at _Client_ calls and provide it with an existing or new _Flyweight_).
 4. You might consider **moving** the _Flyweight_ referencing field of the _Client_ as well as the _extrinsic state_ **to a separate context class**.

# Pros & cons

**Pros**

 - **Memory** : Save lots of RAM.
 - **Response time** : Data caching is likely to improve the response time of your application.
 - **Centralize** the managing mechanism of your objects states.

**Cons**

 - **Memory/CPU tradeoff**
 - **Concurrency** : In a concurrent environment, you might be ending up with multiples instances of the same _Flyweight_ object.
 This problem can be eliminated using the [**Factory**]("../../creational-patterns/factory-pattern") pattern such that _Clients_ obtain flyweights from the **FlyWeightFactory** only.
 - **Provides no reliability on object identity**
    - The same physically created object represents many logically different objects.
    - Therefore, applications that depend on object identity should not use flyweights.
